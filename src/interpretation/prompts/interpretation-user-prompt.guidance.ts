export const INTERPRETATION_USER_GUIDANCE = `Interpretation guidance (respond in Korean):
- Respect the user's emotions/context first.
- Connect retrieved symbol meanings + actions to the actual dream narrative.
- Treat action hints as 비슷한 사례 references—do not overfit to them.
- End with an actionable advice line grounded in the symbols and advice hints.
- Use clear line breaks so the CLI output stays tidy (blank line between ideas).`;
